    <h1>Typography</h1>
    <p>Here are my 8 typographic systems</p>

    <div class="pictures">
        <div class="group">
            <img class="item" src="pictures/Axial.png" alt="An image displaying the Axial typographic system">
            <p class="caption">In Axial typography everything is aligned to an imaginary line. There can be only one line like there is in mine or there could be multiple. I've made mine look a bit more interesting by having the line be visible and divide the page into two, I've also aligned the title to be parallel to the line whereas the rest is perpendicular.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="group">
            <img class="item" src="pictures/Radial.png" alt="An image displaying the Radial typographic system">
            <p class="caption">Words in a Radial typographic system are centred around a circular point on a page. This can give the feeling that they are emerging from or merging into a point of focus for the reader. I've given my circle shading which can look like a shout or that the circle is sort of growing outwards and that the text has flown out of it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="group">
            <img class="item" src="pictures/Dilatational.png" alt="An image displaying the Dilatational typographic system">
            <p class="caption">Unlike in the Radial design where text radiates out of a point, In Dilatational design, the text curves around circular points forming curves. If used incorrectly text can fully curve around a circle and be upside down, but when used in small blocks like in my example you can see that it creates a nice flowing effect.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="group">
            <img class="item" src="pictures/Random.png" alt="An image displaying the Random typographic system">
            <p class="caption">Random systems have no rules at all and can allow for all sorts of jumbled messes of shapes, colours, fonts, and sizes. The lack of form could lead to the reader having difficulty understanding your message but if used effectively it can create an interesting visual experience for them where they may have to turn their head and squint to read it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="group">
            <img class="item" src="pictures/Grid.png" alt="An image displaying the Grid typographic system">
            <p class="caption">The Grid system is one of the oldest systems dating back to the Gutenberg Bible in 1455, it utilises horizontal and vertical lines to structure the layout of your page. These lines are more than often invisible but I've decided to visualise mine to create physical boxes that my text is placed into.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="group">
            <img class="item" src="pictures/Modular.png" alt="An image displaying the Modular typographic system">
            <p class="caption">In the Modular typographic system repeating structures such as hexagons are used to break up the content into separate boxes for you to read. If using squares or circles in the Modular system, your page could end up looking more like the Grid or Dilatational system.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="group">
            <img class="item" src="pictures/Transitional.png" alt="An image displaying the Transitional typographic system">
            <p class="caption">Transitional designs implement natural shapes to allow the text flow or drape over them. This can be in the form of hills or mountains or like in mine where I've made the text look like it's flowing over waves. It's a slightly more disorganised system and is more often used on book covers and movie posters.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="group">
            <img class="item" src="pictures/Bilateral.png" alt="An image displaying the Bilateral typographic system">
            <p class="caption">The Bilateral typographic system uses imaginary centre lines to create centre aligned text that is symmetrically equal on both sides. As a more structured system it can be more challenging to make your design look interesting, this is helped by placing your axes off centre and rotating them, you can also add in shapes like I have to break up the text and give it an extra flair.</p>
