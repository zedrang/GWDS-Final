    <h1>CARP</h1>
    <p>These are my three poster redesigns for the CARP (Contrast, Alignment, Repetition, and Proximity) task.</p>

    <div class="carpblock">
        <div class="carpblock2">
            <img class="carpimage2" src="pictures/Poster 1.png">
            <div class="carptext2">
                <p>In my first design I stayed very simple and barely<br>changed any of the elements that I was given.<br>I aligned all the logos into the bottom right<br>corner with a repeating size and shape for all of<br>them. I decided to highlight the main text to give<br>it some contrast with the background, but the<br>rest of the page seemed jumbled and looks like<br>a mess overall with not much thought to<br>proximity, so I decided to make drastic changes<br>with my second design.<br><br><br></p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="carpblock2">
            <img class="carpimage2" src="pictures/Poster 2.png">
            <div class="carptext2">
                <p>For my second design I used a much simpler<br>background which allows for better contrast with<br>my now all white text. This combined with the<br>repeating font across all text allows for the<br>reader to be able to understand the poster more<br>and take in the information better. I've removed<br>the glaring backgrounds from the logos and<br>aligned them all to the bottom of the page where<br>they're not covering the background. I also<br>incorporated a balloon into the special O of the<br>logo and positioned the main body of text<br>around the curve of the big balloon.</p>

    <div class="carpblock">
        <img class="carpimage" src="pictures/Poster 3.png">
        <div class="carptext">
            <p>My final design for the poster built upon my second<br>design but enhanced it with the use of some more Radial like<br>text around the big balloon and by moving the background up<br>revealing a brighter sky that makes the whole poster pop<br>more. I've moved the date down the bottom onto the colourful<br>balloon background where it can catch your eye more and by<br>moving it all onto one line people are less likely to<br>confuse the dates for times. I've also smoothed out the<br>logos more, so they're more closely aligned with each other<br>in size and uniformity on the colourful background and made<br>more separate from the main section of the poster. Finally,<br>I've again slightly offset each line of the main body of<br>text so it curves around the balloon, but as well this time<br>Ive exaggerated certain words with font size, boldness, and<br>underlining to draw in the eye show off the exciting<br>prospects of the event.</p>
