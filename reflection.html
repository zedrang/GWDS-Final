    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <p class="reflection">This has definitely been my favourite module; I like that with some relatively simple code you can instantly see a whole pretty cool looking website come together and know that you completely made this from scratch by yourself. I'd never used any Adobe softwares before this unit and had actually been a little scared of using them, but once I got to learn InDesign and certainly Illustrator, creating the 8 typography pages was a fun exercise. There were certainly a couple challenges along the way such as trying to get all my text and images on the Worksheets and CARP pages align correctly, but other than that the worksheets and my knowledge from college had me well equipped to make this site. I've always struggled with writing a lot and time management so doing this reflection was probably one of the most challenging parts of the whole assignment but for next term I'm going to work much harder at getting my assignment done more than a day before they're due.</p>
